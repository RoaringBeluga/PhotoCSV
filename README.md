#Photometric report to CSV converter

### Reason for it's existence

When you work in LED lighting QC, what you're going to 
get is a lot of PDF files with spectrophotometer report. 
As they would come in different formats from different 
equipment and often in different languages as well, it 
becomes increasingly hard to analyze the data. If only 
it was some sort of a spreadsheet... and this project
is meant to produce exacly such a spreadsheet.

### Acknowledgements
